# quotes-resubmit  

#### Lab 08: OO Design

###### Challenge  
Use the file recentquotes.json to show random popular book quotes. Your program should use GSON to parse the .json file. The app needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run. The app should choose one quote each time it is run.  
Use JUnit to write at least one test for each of the Feature Tasks.  

#### Lab 09: Web requests
The code read json quote from api then convert it to object using GSON package then we can manipulate the data using java and cut some data and return another. And if you have internet connection the app still work .
To run the app you must add the url of the endpoint api and the output folder file location to display output.
